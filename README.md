# Hi, I’m Jonathan 👋

I’m a senior software developer with **~10 years of experience** spanning backend engineering, cloud‑native
infrastructure, and DevOps automation. I love turning complex problems into elegant, reliable systems -and learning
something new every day.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

### `Rune` - a tiny interpreted language

An interpreter written in **C** to teach myself data structures and algorithms from the ground up -syntax inspired by
Python, with an interactive REPL and AST visualizer.

### Home‑Lab GitOps

Terraform + Flux CD modules that provision and continuously reconcile a self‑hosted **K3s** cluster (Traefik ingress,
MetalLB, external‑dns, BIND9, DHCP, VLAN segmentation, and more).

### CloudFront SPA Pipeline

Migrating a Vercel‑hosted **Next.js** app to an **S3 + CloudFront** static site, backed by **API Gateway & Lambda (
Python/Go)** for content management with DynamoDB.

### Algorithm Visualizers

Interactive maze/graph explorers (DFS/BFS, Manhattan distance tweaks) built with Python + JavaScript to make algorithm
study tactile and fun.

### Istio Rate‑Limiting Lab

Bench‑testing Envoy filters, Redis, and the Kubernetes Gateway API to hit **100 k requests/s** while enforcing
fine‑grained per‑subdomain quotas.

## 📚 Learning & Sharing

I document my journey -successes **and** face‑plants -through blog posts, code comments, and discussions. Current
deep‑dives include:

- Distributed systems & consensus primitives (Raft, TO‑Bcast)
- Performance tuning for JVM & Go micro‑services
- Spaced‑repetition workflows for continuous learning

## 🌱 Open to Collaborate

I’m always excited to chat about infrastructure, dev tooling, and projects that **make an impact**. Feel free to open an
issue, start a discussion, or just say hi.
